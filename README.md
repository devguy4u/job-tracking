# JTME

## Development Tools

- Firebase Auth + Firestore
- React
- Redux + Saga
- Bootstrap

## Notes
In addition to the web app, we have created a chrome extension which can be downloaded 
here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11usDbxUbPIb5IwX9P_fglX8tPBLFrrVq?usp=sharing
though it is also included in this repo if you are cloning or downloading (see folder /jtme-extension)
### Note in order for the chrome extension to work you MUST create your JTME account with google! 

To add the chrome extension to your browser once downloaded:
- unzip the file
- in chrome.. go to manage extensions
- click load unpacked
- select the folder
- pin to toolbar for convenience

Once signed in it will work on any page. The idea is to save you time from switching back and forth between your spreadsheet and the job listing.
